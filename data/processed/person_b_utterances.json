The conditions that you have - ASD, ADHD and complex PTSD - don't justify forcing someone to stay in a mental hospital. Complex PTSD is varied in presentation. I believed that your dad had manipulated you into checking in to the hospital, and that the reason that you were so frustrated at being there was because you shouldn't have been in there at all. I didn't understand the reason for men being blocked from seeing you. I felt like I had been respectful when talking to you, and that things had moved quickly, but I felt like that was due to the strength of our connection, not your vulnerability. You made me feel special. You were kind to me and helped me to accept that I had been in an abusive relationship. I felt like I understood you, but I was only starting to learn who you are. It was only parts of you that I understood. It was only when you left and Jack moved in that I understood how vulnerable you are.",

What I couldn't see in myself, I was able to in someone else. You are right. I do have some very big blind spots. I am sorry. So at the same time that you have been doing so well, engaging with support services and moving forward, you have had to rely on a clueless dickhead to get you there. You did tell me that you were vulnerable while you were in hospital too. I made the assumption that because I am respectful and value consent and autonomy, you would not feel any obligation to me. I was wrong to assume. That failed to take into account the abuse that you had experienced and the survival strategies that developed as a result. I also failed to consider the perceived power differential between us. I had never heard the term before. I don't consider myself above you, or anyone.",
