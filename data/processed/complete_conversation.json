I believed that your dad had manipulated you into checking in to the hospital, and that the reason that you were so frustrated at being there was because you shouldn't have been in there at all. I didn't understand the reason for men being blocked from seeing you. I felt like I had been respectful when talking to you, and that things had moved quickly, but I felt like that was due to the strength of our connection, not your vulnerability. You made me feel special. You were kind to me and helped me to accept that I had been in an abusive relationship. I felt like I understood you, but I was only starting to learn who you are.

So at the same time that you have been doing so well, engaging with support services and moving forward, you have had to rely on a clueless dickhead to get you there. You did tell me that you were vulnerable while you were in hospital too. I made the assumption that because I am respectful and value consent and autonomy, you would not feel any obligation to me. I was wrong to assume. That failed to take into account the abuse that you had experienced and the survival strategies that developed as a result.
